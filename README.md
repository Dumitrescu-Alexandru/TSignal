# TSignal

TSignal is a deep architecture for Signal Peptide (SP) and cleavage site (CS) prediction inspired by the popular sequence translator model introduced in "Attention is all you need" [1]. We introduce the first unstructured predictor model in this field and provide extensive analysis to visualize its advantages over the structured counterparts. Our model takes advantage of the powerful encoder-decoder architecture of the original transformer natural language translator, to which we incorporate various task-specific additions, to help the model learn in our small data setting. Our model uses transfer learning with pre-trained weights from [4]. For detailed explanations of the architecture, our preprint is now available at [*TSignal: A transformer model for signal peptide prediction*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.02.493958v1) [2].

## 1 Installation

Please install Python 3.7.7. Other versions are not guaranteed to work.

### 1.1 Required packages

Use pip install -r requirements.txt

## 2 Data

**Necessary for reproducing the main results:** We use data from [3]. Add the necessary training
binaries directly from [Link to CV files](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/h3dyfr358optb7to5n9ma/h?dl=0&rlkey=iwvnr6bcklhtogiz9t3pterir) or download from [SignalP 6.0](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP-6.0) 
the train_set.fasta file "SignalP 6.0 Training set" and add it to sp_data/sp6_data/ folder (in the latter case, the cross-validation binaries should automatically be created). In either case, please properly cite the authors of the homology-split data. The benchmark data on which we
report the results is found in "SignalP 5.0 Benchmark set", which can be found in the data section at the same link [SignalP 6.0](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP-6.0) (also add it to sp_data/). Note that results will be predicted for the whole homology-partitioned data, and the benchmark SignalP 5.0 data 
will just specify which of those sequences to be accounted for in the final resultsbut in the functions of misc/visualization.py, it will be used to report performance on this data if specified so (to compare
against SignalP 6.0 results reported in their manuscript for instance, do set benchmark=True).

The model should automatically set up binaries "sp6_partitioned_data_<test/train>_<fold_no>.bin" in sp_data folder based 
on the downloaded fasta file (which should also be in sp_data folder) the first time a model is trained.
  

## 3 Usage

ProtBERT will automatically be downloaded to sp_data/models folder when training with <tune_bert> parameter set to true.

The base fasta file needs to be in the correct folder for training (refer to Section 2).

### 3.1 Predict on your own sequences

Download our pre-trained model from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lfuleg9470s7nqx/deployment_sep_pe_swa_extra_inpemb_on_gen_best_eval_only_dec.pth?dl=0) and add it in sp_data folder. Then, add the file containing the test sequences (fasta or binary format) in the sp_data folder.

The fasta or binary format files need to be provided via the argument "--test_files <test_file>" (see Example 1 in example_runs.txt): fasta and binary formats. If a fasta file is given as argument, a corresponding binary file will automatically be created and added in the same folder (sp_data/).

If a binary file is given to --test_files, a dictionary of the form {sequence:[embedding, label_sequence, life_group, sp-type]} will be required. Since it is used for testing, all entries may be random, and the binaries are created this way for compatibility with training datasets. Refer to "sp_data/test_seqs.bin" as an example binary test file.

To extract saliency maps of some sequences: follow the same procedures as in extracting predictions, and simply add "--compute_saliency" argument to your call.

### 3.2  Test the performance of the model

- **Necessary for reproducing the main results:**: To re-create a similar experiment on SignalP 6.0 data, 3 different runs are needed (refer to example 2 from
example_runs.txt and its comments). At the end, plot_sp6_vs_tnmt and plot_sp6_vs_tnmt_mcc methods from misc/visualize_cs_pred_results.py 
may be used for CS-F1 and MCC1/2. Note that all predictions from all runs have to be in a folder <fld_name> containing <run_name>\_<fold_i>_<fold_j> files, followed by various exntesions
  (including but not limited to):
  -  _best_sptype.bin 
  - _best.bin
  - .log 
<br/> In general, it should be enough to do cp run_name* /\<path>/\<to>/misc/<fld_name>, after running for each fold pair 0,1/0,2/1,2

- If a different dataset needs to be tested, refer to the 3.4 to create your own sequence file. After predicting the 
sequences, use the correct and true predictions with misc/visualize_cs_pred_results.py methods get_pred_perf_sptype and get_cs_perf
to get the SP type/CS performance on your predictions.

### 3.3  Train a new model while tuning bert
Recreating a deployment model: First, follow the instructions on Section 2. If you wish to replicate the experiment results, refer to arguments --train_folds 
from main.py. If you wish to create another deployment model, trained on (D<sub>1,train</sub>, D<sub>2,train</sub>, 
D<sub>3,train</sub>; validated on (D<sub>1,test</sub>, D<sub>2,test</sub>, D<sub>3,test</sub>) refer to --deployment_model 
argument in main.py.

### 3.4  Train a new model <u>while not tuning bert</u>

Currently, a non-tuning-ProtBERT model only works with global label predictions. Therefore, use_glbl_lbls needs to be 
true and glbl_lbl_version to the desired SP type prediction approach. Additionally, for efficiency reasons, when not 
tuning the ProtBERT model, the embeddings for a dataset are pre-computed. When not calling main.py with --tune_bert, 
these will be automatically computed for SignaP 6.0 data and the load will starts from there.

### 3.5  Test on your own sequences

If you want to test the model on your own sequences, please refer to create_test_files.py script, method for the method
create_test_file(). If you want to use our pre-trained model, refer to Example 1 in example_runs.txt. To also create a 
saliency map for the predictions, add --compute_saliency to the example 1.
