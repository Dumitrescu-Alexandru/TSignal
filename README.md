# TSignal

TSignal is a deep architecture for Signal Peptide (SP) and cleavage site (CS) prediction inspired by the popular sequence translator model introduced in "Attention is all you need paper" [1]. We introduce the first unstructured predictor model in this field and provide extensive analysis to visualize its advantages over the structured counterparts. Our model takes advantage of the powerful encoder-decoder architecture of the original transformer natural language translator, to which we incorporate various task-specific additions, to help the model learn in our small data setting. Our model uses transfer learning with pre-trained weights from [4]. For detailed explanations of the architecture, see our paper *TSignal: A transformer model for signal peptide prediction* [2].

## Installation

Please install Python 3.7.7. Other versions are not guaranteed to work.

### Required packages

Use pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data

We use data from [3]. In order to train the model, download from [SignalP 6.0](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP-6.0).

In order to set up the same training procedure, do:
- run read_extract_sp6_data.py from sp_data/sp6_data/
- ...
  

## Usage

### Using our deployment model

Download our pre-trained model from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lfuleg9470s7nqx/deployment_sep_pe_swa_extra_inpemb_on_gen_best_eval_only_dec.pth?dl=0) and add it in sp_data folder.

To extract sequence predictions:
- prepare binary sequence file with:...

To extract saliency maps of some sequences:

- To extract sequence predictions use python main.py --test_seqs ...
- to extract the saliency map of some prediction use ...; a binary file with the gradients wrt. the inputs will be saved as "blabla.bin"
